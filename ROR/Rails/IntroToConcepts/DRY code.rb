# DRY Code 
# Don't Repeat Yourself 
# - code can be accomplished by refactoring or 'extracting away code redundancies'. 

# We accomplished a significant amount of this by --
# --using a couple of private methods in our articles controller and using partials in our views. 

# Clean code should always be a priority once features are built-- 
# --and working as we want so that our code is easy to read and easily maintainable

# Naming the partials file
# Ex.
# _form.html.erb
# _messages.html.erb



# Private Keyword
# you can set the private keyword in the controller to --
# --just use those def variables in only that controller
# any methods or actions under this keyword will available only for this controller
