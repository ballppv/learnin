# Intro to Classes
# the goal of object-oriented design is to use code to model real-life things as classes
# An object is a custom container for data. It is made from a class

# Object Attributes and Methods
# Instance variables (attributes) are variables that belong to object
# Attributes provide information about the object's current state
# Instance methods interact with the object. They also belong to the object
# Encapsulation is a OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object

# Classes and Objects
# A class is the blueprint, pattern, template, or outline for an object
# An objct is an instance of the class. It is created from the class
# Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class
# A class is called an abstact type because it hides the complexity of interacting with the data, --
# --much like a method abstacts the complexity of a process
