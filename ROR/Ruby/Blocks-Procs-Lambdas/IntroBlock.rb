# a block is a collection of code to be executed

# Blocks must be attached to a method call

# Blocks alter the execution of the method

# a block is not an argument/ parameter to the method

# Blocks can be defined with {} or "do end".

# a block can get or update the value of local variables within the block



# Methods vs. Blocks

# Methods can be invoked over and over

# in comparison, a block will only be called once, then dissapear
